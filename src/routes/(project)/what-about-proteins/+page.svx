      "What about Proteins?‚Äù is maybe one of the most asked questions to vegetarians. It arises from the simplistic view - and surrounded by problems - that meat and eggs are the main protein sources available.

      The question is also the title of this printable piece that encodes the macronutrient amounts and the saturated fat percentage in certain foods, which are organized into food groups. Values refer to raw portions of 100g.
